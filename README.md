# **[OpenSpeedTest™️](https://openspeedtest.com)** -  Pure HTML5 Network Performance Estimation Tool.

Hi! I'm [Vishnu](https://vishnu.pro) the one who developed **[OpenSpeedTest™️](https://openspeedtest.com)**. OpenSpeedTest use XMLHttpRequest (XHR), HTML, CSS, JS, & SVG For this network performance estimation tool. I started this project in 2011 and moved to OpenSpeedTest.com dedicated Project/Domain Name in 2013.

Tested up to 10Gbps on real NIC and up to 30Gbps on Virtual NIC. You can run a speed test from any device with a Web Browser that is IE10 or new. That means you can test your network speed from your Smart TV, Console, etc. No additional plugins or software required.


For testing 10GbE or more, you will need to use the latest hardware. I used M1 MacMini with Built-in 10GbE and a Linux Machine with AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900XT. Safari was the fastest browser when I tested it. Chrome and Chromium Edge can handle 10Gbps or more on macOS and Linux. You can test more than 10Gbps with Chrome or Safari on M1 MacMini or newer hardware. Or on a Linux Machine with Chrome or Chromium browser using a 3900XT or newer Processor. Up to 2.5 to 3.6 Gbps can be tested on almost all popular browsers and devices. Windows max limit was around 8.5 Gbps for download and 9.4Gbps for upload. Tested on Edge and Chrome. Use Private Window or Incognito Window if you found unusual test results. Probably some Extensions are slowing the speed test process. This tool can be used to check the browser performance and impact of Extensions on your browsing experience.
